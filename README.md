## Welcome to my slice of the internet! :sunglasses:

### What I'm tinkering with right now
* Self-Hosting
* Python
* Ricing
* Machine Learning
* Arch Linux

### But what about things that aren't tech related??
* Taking names on chess.com right [here](https://www.chess.com/member/yourmumssidepiece "Let's dance")
* Currently reading "Seven Pillars Of Wisdom" by Thomas Edward Lawrence
* Still mourning the death of Metal Gear Solid
* Slowly taking over the world with succulents
